Using the 'Dell Command-Update' app, I keep seeing the 'Intel 100 series chipset driver ver. 10.1.1.13' coming up as a recommended update, even though I've now installed it 3 times (and it shows in 'update history' as having been installed 3 times). But in fact it's not installing, because when looking at the 'system details' link in the Dell Command-Update app I see that what's actually installed is 'series 100 chipset driver version 10.1.1.9'. Any thoughts on why I can't update this driver. Мультизагрузочный диск прежде всего предназначен для "чистой" установки с загрузочного.

The following updates are available for all Surface Pro 4 devices running Windows 10 April 2018 Update, version 1803 or greater. \ 50 Dollar Paypal Reward to Problem Solver\ amp#x200B; I am at my wits end with this game. After upgrading my pc to a 2080ti and fresh installing windows, I cannot get BDO to stop dropping my fps from 95 to 85 at random intervals. As long as I am simply walking in a circle in an open field, and my fps uncapped is 125+, for some reason the game just decides to drop the fps well below what it should. My temps are all under 70c, there is no throttling, and regardless of settings this occurs. P8H61-M PRO boards with exclusive ASUS iGPU Boost accelerate Intel® integrated graphics through an on-board switch or via the included AI Suite II utility. So, from my first Apple \ \ to the Mac, Apple PowerPC, silly egg-shaped iMacs, MacBook Pros, and iMacs. I've finally decided that it's time to test the PC waters. My current setup is Windows 10 through Bootcamp on my 2013 iMac. i7-447 with 8GB and an Nvidia GTX 780M (8GB). First of all, I'm a low-needs kind of gamer. With my current setup, I have no problems playing games like Fallout 4, Witcher 3, or Kingdom Come: Deliverance, but I do play these on Low settings and I'm guessing I average. This motherboard supports the latest Intel® Lynnfield processors in LGA1156 package, which has memory and PCI Express controller integrated to support 2-channel (4 DIMMs) DDR3 memory and 16 PCI Express 2.0 lanes, providing great graphics performance.

So I have been having some issues in source games lately.TF2 and CSGO to be exact.prior to march 23rd everything was fine and nice and all was well,in both games i would get 100+fps on highest possible settings(i did some teaks on console to get the best out)in hyper hectic situations fps would drop to 80\~70 and normally would contest 150+fps,and in low demanding maps like MGE maps get over 300 fps,it has been like this since I installed both games However after 23rd march things changed.I. 
Hey guys. I just build a new PC (see specs below) and used my old GTX 960 4GB from my old computer as I had upgraded it a few years back. After seeing what an improvement I got from the new computer I realized how bottle necked my GPU was. So I wanted to upgrade my GPU to a RX 580 8GB. I bought one off eBay that didn't seem to have been mined or abused. It was in great looking condition, came with all the packaging and seller said he was upgrading his GPU. Seller had 100% feedback rating. So before I begin, I have never had this issue in the past and the wireless adapter has always worked flawlessly for me (Onward included). I have only recently changed to a better GPU (from 970 strix) and still see the same issue. This problem also does not occur on any other games for me other than FO4VR and Contractors VR (which is having the problem far less frequently). Here are my specs: Asus Z170-pro 16gb @3200mhz (XMP) i5-6600k (H100iGTX and OC'd to 4.2ghz) RTX 2070 STRIX OC edition. The following is a new benchmarking of the graphical performance of latest NVIDIA driver version ( 418.81 ) and a selection of two prior driver versions ( 417.71 , 417.35 ) on a gaming rig with a high-end Turing GPU. ## Changelog: No major changes or updates.

The following is a new benchmarking of the graphical performance of latest NVIDIA driver version ( 419.17 ) on a gaming rig with a high-end Pascal GPU. Since this is my first run, I have no previous comparisons this time around. I tried to keep testing as similar to RodroG's as possible, although I did have to cut out some game benchmarks (due to not owning them) and cut the number of passes in half, from 6 to 3. ## Changelog: First iteration of Pascal Performance Benchmarks by me, since. Questions - What should I try next? - Could a bad PSU cause this? - Could a bad hard drive cause this? - Are these signs of a bad motherboard? Any input is greatly appreciated Got home from work, turned on PC, logged in, went to Amazon and then it froze; black screen but high contrast colors showed through the black. It was mostly black though. Restarted, made it to login, black screen crash again with some visible background. I restarted like 5-10 times and it kept failing. I finally would like to make a small contribution to the Master Race with a story that happened to me, after endless frustrations with stuttering and frame drops in games. I was having this exact problem, until yesterday, when I finally found a fix for my case in particular, so I decided to share my story, as I realised many folks have similar problems with stuttering and, as I realised, for the same reasons. Little bit of backstory: I had a pretty decent system until the beginning Hello everyone - I just built this - \ PCPartPicker part list\ ( https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4rr8tg (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4rr8tg)) / \ Price breakdown by merchant\ ( https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4rr8tg/by\_merchant/ (https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4rr8tg/by_merchant/)) Type Item Price :---- :---- :---- \ \ CPU\ \ \ AMD - Ryzen 5 1600 3.2 GHz 6-Core Processor\ ( https://pcpartpicker.com/product/mV98TW/amd-ryzen-5-1600-32ghz-6-core-processor-yd1600bbaebox (https://pcpartpicker.

Restarted, made it to login, black screen crash again with some visible background. I restarted like 5-10 times and it kept failing at login or 1-30 seconds after login. I turned off the power switch. Turned it back on. And it booted up! I gamed it for about 2-3 hours and then black screen again with some pixels 
I had a perfectly working 10.14.3 build, but running the update to 10.14.4 has been problematic. While the system does work, I'm getting random kernel panics that make it super unstable. Now to get my laptop working with dual monitor output I had to use a Skylake spoof instead of my native Kaby Lake. I used Hackintool to originally get this all working, but now any framebuffer patch I output there I can't seem to make a bootable system. Has anyone else run into issues with this update? In Googli. Specs: MOBO: Gigabyte Z170x Gaming 7 CPU: i7-7700K GPU: Sapphire Nitro+ RX580 amp#x200B; Recently switched over from a GTX 970 to an RX580 so I can make the jump to Mojave, plus I was hoping for better Final Cut Pro performance. I removed all Nvidia drivers and flags, and the RX580 worked OOTB, although in BIOS I had to adjust iGPU from disabled to enabled and set my primary display output as PCI-1 to get Final Cut to launch and preview to work properly. Unfortunately, without UPDATE: this fix helped solve some tracking issues, which got me some FPS back: https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/8kjrs7/attention\_new\_win\_10\_update\_turns\_sensor\_power/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/8kjrs7/attention_new_win_10_update_turns_sensor_power/) Since this worked for me, I think this issue has something to do with spotty tracking causing framerate drops, but that's just speculation. amp#x200B; I've been experiencing performance issues with Beat Saber. Over 60 tech companies from all over the world have joined forces in an insane Twitter thread that went viral. Each company joining the wholesome gaming giveaway did so because PC culture and gaming goes beyond brands and companies. It's about being connected through a lifestyle we're all passionate about. The support from the community has been overwhelming and the amount of donations is simply amazing. Huuuge shout out to all companies involved! And special thanks to Jedson from Overclock.ne.

Credit to /u/RodroG for the original benchmark format and formula. EDIT: New numbers with the removal of the KB are now up. 2nd EDIT: A new update has been released for 1809 (KB4489899) that supposedly fixes the performance issues of KB4482887. I will be testing this over the next couple of days and will put up a new post that compares.
