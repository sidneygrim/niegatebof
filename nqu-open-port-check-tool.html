                            <p> 24 дек 2015  The open port checker tool allows you to check port status of your external IP address or any IP address you have entered and scan open ports. Advanced Port Scanner - бесплатный сканер портов, позволяющий быстро найти все открытые порты на компьютерах сети и определить программы. I have a weird problem where I can't connect to my server via public ip if I'm on the same router as the server, but I can connect to my server when I'm using another source of internet.(e.g. mobile data). Checked with open port check tool and they seem to say it's up. Anyone has any experience with this before? TLDR - port forward works but only on external internet. Port numbers range from 0 to 65536, but only ports numbers 0 to 1024 are designated as  OPENPORT, 260/udp, Openport. OPENPORT, 260/tcp, Openport. So, I've been searching for a few hours, and I can't make heads nor tails of any of the info I've been finding.I have a Minecraft server up and running on my server pc, I can access it via local ip( 192.168.1.2 (https://192.168.1.2)), I can ping the external domain( nordrassil.azeroth.pw (https://nordrassil.azeroth.pw)), but I can't connect to the server via external address at all. I feel like I set up port forwarding correctly, and using Open Port Check Tool shows port 25565 as being

Ideally, I want to max out the bandwidth used and have as many open connections going through this thing as possible. I'm planning to hit it from multiple sites to see how it handles a bit of load - we want to be able to predict when we'll need to scale up and the only way to get reliable data is to test it. There's plenty out there that will test a target like a web server, but nothing cheap that really hammers the link itself. List of well known, registered, and dynamic/private ports. .

I have a remote Plex server. I also have a VNC client installed so I can view the server and make changes. I'm having issues accessing my server all of sudden through plex.tv. Here are the facts: The server shows "Fully accessible outside your network" (https://15254b2dcaab7f5478ab-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/plex.vanillacommunity.com/editor/b5/tlu5sa8ov7td.jpg) Open Port Check Tool shows the port open Remote access page shows correct Static IP address. 9 ноя 2017  sudo yum install net-tools #RHEL/CentOS $ sudo apt install net-tools  Check- Port-Using-netstat-Command  Команда lsof (LiSt Open Files) используется для отображения всех  Find-Port-and-Process-ID-in-Linux. I have installed OpenVPN via pippin installer and everything seems to have gone well. I'm assuming that my ISP is blocking 1194; however, I'm not 100% sure how to confirm this?

Ports forwarded directly, RCON works when using my external ip, plus if I try to connect to the game with the external ip "Connection Failed: Invalid_Address". Through the test portal sites, my port 28018 (RCON) is open, and the 28016 (GAME) is closed  In my modem is enabled DMZHOST(frees all ports) Firewall is configured to free the ports 28018, 28016  I tried to invert the ports to confirm that the problem was not on port 28016, and really the problem is not on the port ScreenShot. 
Upon first receiving my PC it had a wireless adapter. I port forwarded that ip for a game and had no issues once I'd figured things out properly. Then, my adapter broke. Another one was purchased and I forwarded the port again - noticing it had changed. From that moment on nothing worked, at all, even a little. I have gone through exactly the same process numerous times over the past few months to no avail. Even after wiring an Ethernet cable from my living room to PC it still did not work. Sé que hay foros específicos para este tipo de posts, pero mi intención es compartir una solución (que me tardé mucho en encontrar) para la mayor cantidad de usuarios, no necesariamente solo con usuarios nerdosos como yo, que son los que usualmente postean en esos foros En mi rancho, Cablemás está proveyendo unos routers marca UBEE, modelo DVW324. Están muy estables, rápidos y permiten mayor ancho de banda que los modelos anteriores. El problema es que desde el primer día, el técnico Hello everyone, lately I have been trying to set up a server with Amazon EC2, everything has been going pretty smoothly until now. I have made a very simple chat program using C# that works flawlessly when running both the server and the client on my computer. However, when launching the server part on my ec2 server (and verifying that the server is listening with netstat), and the client part on my computer, the client can't connect and says "A connection attempt failed because the connected. I'm trying to set up a Minecraft server but I'm running into some issues. I'm sure it's something I'm doing wrong. My router is a TP-Link TL-WR1043N/ND v2 running OpenWrt Chaos Calmer 15.05 / LuCI (git-15.248.30277-3836b45). I'm trying to forward port 25565. According to the firewall tab, I have the port forwarded but when I run an open port check tool, it's showing closed. What am I doing wrong. I've tried the open port check tool but every port I try it says it closed. is there a software that scans all my ports and tells I went into the security group for that instance and added a rule to allow inbound traffic on port 587. I've rebooted it multiple times and have waited 2 days, but it still remains closed. I tried using the open port check tool and telnet 587, but they say that it is closed. Edit: running netstat -ntlp shows that 587 is actively listening to any address. Hello! So ever since GTAV on the Xbox 360, I've had GTA:O issues. I think everyone has. Lots of "_____ has left" for every player in the session. I thought it would be fixed for PC, but I guess it might be my problem, and not the server? Time and time again I see the mass-"____ has left", but in servers where I am playing with friends who have no troubles and are never kicked. Just me, over and over. I want to make sure I'm forwarding my ports properly though. Using the Open Port Check. 
All I'm trying to do is set up a Minecraft server for me and my nephew who lives in another state. His mom is going to buy him the game for his birthday tomorrow and I'm trying to set this up so we can play the game together. ISP: AT&T U-Verse Modem: 2Wire 3600HGV OS: Windows 7 64bit I followed these instruction exactly ( and had spent hours today on the phone. I'm having some trouble connecting to a VPN I set up last night on an old Windows Laptop. I think some of the issue involved may include port forwarding. I looked online and saw that port 1723 was the port that would allow me to access the IP address (which I had made static) of my VPN. So, I set up a VPN access on my Macbook Pro and it tells me I need a Machine Authentication, I'm not sure where to find that in the VPN Settings on the Windows? Will I not be able to tunnel into the VPN through. I've seen multiple posts about connection errors online, so I thought I might put some help all in one place. If I am giving false info, please respond so I can correct it. I hope this helps! From Nintendo's site: Error Code: 118-0516 (also 118-0502) Situation: This error code typically indicates an issue communicating and matchmaking with other players. This is often caused by network firewalls blocking necessary network traffic. This can be caused by your network, or the network. Open Port Check Tool: Error: I could not see your service on 00.000.00.00 on port (25565) Reason: Connection timed out I can connect to the world no problem, but my friend has been trying to join the server and he keeps getting the "Connection timed out" bit. I allowed all the Java Binaries(Program Files/Program Files x86) through the firewall and still nadda. Not sure what else to do, any suggestions. I feel like an idiot. No matter what I try, I cannot get a private MC server to work! I have followed the steps given to me on a hundred different sites, but nothing changes. My friends always get a "Connection refused" error. I believe the 25565 port is being forwarded correctly, but I don't know for sure. I'm still pretty new to this whole thing. My router is a WRT160Nv2, and I'm running on Ubuntu 10.10, if that is any help. I've tried the routers 'Single Port Forwarding' and 'Port Range.
