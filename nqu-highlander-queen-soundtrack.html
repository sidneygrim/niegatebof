I really wish someone would pick up the Highlander franchise. It had such a cool concept, an all-star cast, and a soundtrack from fucking Queen. It was the first thing i saw that showed what living eternally would really be like. And all that came from it was a bunch of shitty sequels and a mediocre television series. A little background on the movie if you've (somehow) never seen it. Our star Connor MacLeod is an immortal (more on that in a second) born in the Scottish Highlands in the 1500s. When he went to his first battle he was mortally wounded, when he didn't die he was cast out of his village into banishment. He eventually settled down and found love in a mountainous area fairly secluded from society. Soon an immortal Spaniard (Sean Connery) takes Connor under his wing and teaches Where was the rift between them and the sex pistols? Why did they make it look like they left their record company AFTER recording Night At The Opera? Why did they make it look like Live Aid was the pinnacle end of the Queen story? Why we're their very public criticisms of bands, the media, and the music industry ignored? Why was their involvement with movie soundtracks left out? Flash Gordon? Highlander? Top Gun etc? Those soundtracks kept their careers alive when no one was buying Queen albums. 
But I've created a new sub r/FanAlbums (https://www.reddit.com/r/FanAlbums) where you can post those perfect Queen comps you made or maybe that forgotten Highlander soundtrack you have or any other music content you enjoy Cheers. 2018 came and went. Everyone is sharing their movie experiences and I will join in. At the start of the year I set out to watch as many movies as I could, and I am very happy with my results. I was able to watch 369 movies and TV seasons this year. The first of which was I, Tonya and the last, earlier today, was Wreck it Ralph 2  This has been my most intense movie watching year since I started keeping score back in 2014 when I saw the Winter Soldier in the cinema. Here are my previous. I'm watching Ted, and they are at the Sam Jones part. And I'm watching and my brain asks me isn't it strange how Queen performed the soundtrack for Flash Gordon and Highlander. I'm looking forward for the third season and the two subjects that I'm most curious about are the sound effects and the soundtrack. I hope that they put a lot sound effects in Alicization arc, they did this in Ordinal Scale and it was great. The sound effects makes the action scenes better. About the soundtrack, I'm not a fan of Kajiura's work in SAO series, for me, there's a lack of greatness and something memorable, only few tracks have this vibe. I love the work of composers like Hiroyuki. 
Today is June 27, 2018 Started on May 31, 2018 Here's a nice little gem from the past. Now, I had only heard of the series' reputation before watching this movie. I know that the sequels have tarnished whatever goodwill the original movie had created, with the second one being one of the worst movies ever made. I had never seen any of the Highlander movies before so I can't comment on the horribleness of the sequels. Although I have heard the cover of Queen's "Princes of the Universe" https://youtu.be/Tfm6EvoE7FA (Skip to around 1:10 in the clip above to see what I am making reference to) When watching TLJ trailer and seeing Rey atop the cliffside swinging the lightsaber, I am instantly reminded of Connor amp Ramirez training in The Highlander. I think the first Highlander is a truly underrated masterpiece with some excellent visuals, top notch soundtrack from Queen, riveting score, and a really great fantasy story as well. Anyone else think Rian Johnson may have drawn. For me, it's definitely Highlander  I just watched it again for the first time in about 15 years. I totally whooshed ( on the not-so-subtle allusions, critiques, and comments on gay culture in the 1980s. From the "heart of the stag" scene to the disarming of Ramirez in the woods scene to the swordplay in dark alleys at night scenes to the "can't have kids" thing to the secret-group-of-dudes-that-have-to-pretend-they're-somebody-they're-not-lest-they. I was just thinking about watching and loving Highlander when I was a kid and the Queen soundtrack. Wondering what other soundtracks are awesome. Verified?

( Jason: All three were different incidents. Lightning one happened while being stupid. I was out with my girlfriend. 
What one Queen album was used as the soundtrack to a film. Name the album and the film? It's not Flash Gordon or Highlander. Please help.I'm trying to win a contest. </p>
