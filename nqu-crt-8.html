Just wondering if anyone could use this if so let me know and we could This is a TO of the Mexican melee community in the capital city, he travels all the way from the northern part of the city the southern part using public transportation (around 8.7 miles), he doesn't always carries a TV, but he carries a lot of heavy equipment to make the tournament a more suitable venue for everyone (consoles, electronics, controller repair station, cables, and even furniture and tv´s), he doesn't really get paid much for this, nor he has to do it, he does it because he loves. Every now and then it really gets to me that I used to have a perfect working condition HP Visualize J5600 that I randomly got on eBay around 2010 for ~0, but literally just curbed it about three years later in a move. Nowadays I’ll probably never be able to get it back because they run more like 00. There have been other losses. For the same reason I parted with an SGI Octane, but at least that one I sold. Still, another story where I bought at ~0 and prices have skyrocketed since. Not even necessarily a specific brand. I just don't really know much about speakers and am not sure what my options are. I'm mostly just playing NES, SNES, Genesis, and GB by way of Super Game Boy. Looking to boost those glorious channels when tearing through some Castlevania or MegaMan X. Kind of hoping it's like old CRTs where I can just find them on the curb or for free/cheap on Craigslist. Thanks for any advice.

In this case these games were published. I seriously don’t know why. I recorded a video as proof, but reddit won’t I know that CRT is obvious difference but I don't see the difference between 4:3 and pixel perfect unless I'm not looking 
I recently bought RGB SCART cables for my Wii and PS2 and as tends to happen with some CRTs is that they are forced into an aspect ratio due to the supplied 5V on pin 8. This means that whenever I tried to play games in their native 4:3 aspect ratio they would be stretched out. I've tried manually adjusting the aspect ratio with the remote but the 4:3 option is still stretched to 16:9. The common fix for this that you'll see is to float or remove pin 8 which is responsible for auto scart. I've been looking everywhere for these shoes but they seem to have sold out a couple of years ago. Looking for a new or used pair in a US 8 or 8.5.
